    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:     74
      Number with same-slice register load:     35
      Number with same-slice carry load:        39
      Number with other load:                    0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                 1,478 out of   2,278   64%
  Number of MUXCYs used:                       844 out of   4,556   18%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        5,383
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         4,885 out of   5,383   90%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   7 out of   5,383    1%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:             223 out of  18,224    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
